{"text": "The basic unit of electrical current in the International System of Units (SI), equivalent to one coulomb per second, formally defined to be the constant current which if maintained in two straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible circular cross section, and placed one meter apart in vacuum, would produce between these conductors a force equal to 2 × 10 −7newton per meter of length.", "words": ["ampere"]},
{"text": "When a satellite follows a non-circular orbit around the earth, the satellite's path is an ellipse with the center of the earth at one focus. Such a satellite has variable altitude and variable orbital speed. The point of lowest altitude is called perigee. The term also applies to the minimum distance in kilometers or miles between the satellite and the center of the earth. (Perigee can be measured between the satellite and the earth's surface, although this is a less precise specification because the earth is not a perfect sphere. The difference is approximately 4,000 miles or 6,400 kilometers.)", "words": ["time to perigee"]},

{"text": "Celsius, also known as centigrade, is a metric scale and unit of measurement for temperature. As an SI derived unit, it is used by most countries in the world. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701–1744), who developed a similar temperature scale. The degree Celsius (°C) can refer to a specific temperature on the Celsius scale as well as a unit to indicate a temperature interval, a difference between two temperatures or an uncertainty. Before being renamed to honour Anders Celsius in 1948, the unit was called centigrade, from the Latin centum, which means 100, and gradus, which means steps.", "words": ["Celsius"]},
{"text": "In computer architecture, A control bus is (part of) a computer bus, used by CPUs for communicating with other devices within the computer. While the address bus carries the information about the device with which the CPU is communicating and the data bus carries the actual data being processed, the control bus carries commands from the CPU and returns status signals from the devices. For example, if the data is being read or written to the device the appropriate line (read or write) will be active (logic one).", "words": ["data bus control"]},
